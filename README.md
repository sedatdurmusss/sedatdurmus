Hello, my name is Sedat Durmuş. 
<br>
I have been currently pursuing my doctoral studies. I have always been interested in the software industry throughout my university life, and thus I received Android Studio Java training from Turkcell Academy. I focused on improving myself by using paid and free educational channels such as Udemy and youtube. I continued both my education life and my field of interest. After my master's degree, my sister and I established a social enterprise called Vaveyla and developed the application together, formed a team and won awards in various competitions. We were accepted to İTÜ Çekirdek and BTM Pre-Incubation Centers and our 6-month training continued. We took a break from our initiative because of the outbreak of Covid -19 and I have been recently continuing my doctoral education.
